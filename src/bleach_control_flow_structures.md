# Control Flow Structures

## Overview
Control Flow Structures are constructs that dictate the order in which statements are executed. They allow the program to make decisions, repeat operations, and manage the flow of execution based on certain conditions.

## Conditional Statements
Such statements allow the program to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to ```true``` or ```false```.

### If Statement


## Loops
Loop statements are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, either a fixed number of times or until a certain condition is met.

### While Loop

### DoWhile Loop

### For Loop


## Branching
Branching statements allow the program to jump to a different part of the code based on certain conditions during runtime.


## Function Calls
Even though the topic of functions and methods has not been addressed yet, such structures affect the control flow of a program during execution.

Functions and methods are blocks of code that can be called from different regions of a program, allowing for code reuse and better organization.

When it comes to the flow followed by the code during runtime, it enters the function when it is called, executes the functionâ€™s code, and then returns to the point after the function call.
